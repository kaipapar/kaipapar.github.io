## Idea and plan
The idea is to make a desktop application which uses visual cues to mix an audio stream in real time. This is to be able to combine a visual source and an aural source tangentially together so together they create a new experience.

That is the general description, the details of how it is implemented and what features it will have will be set in the requirements in one of the next posts. It might be a while before I get to it, but it should be coming.

The initial method of this series is a feasibility study on the subject, and if it is deemed feasible I will implement it. The feasibility criteria will be set in the next blog post, regarding which requirements the project needs to cover in order to be deemed feasible. 

## History
I had already started this project once a few years ago, but my interest, confidence nor skills were up to par with what needed to be done to succeed. So the project collapsed onto itself from the get go. I'm trying to do another go at this, since I think the subject and end result should be interesting.
