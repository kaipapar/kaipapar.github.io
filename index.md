I wanted to have a site to house unprofessional professional ramblings, projects, creative ideas and issues, housed somewhere in the peripheria of social media, as opposed to posting to a stream on linkedin or instagram.

Topics I might or might not touch on:
1. Software and other professional items
    - CV 
    - Completed and upcoming projects
2. Non SW related projects
    - eg some woodworking
3. Music
    - Trying to describe what I like somehow
4. Poetry
    - Text found and text written
6. Visual art
    - Possibly mostly my own process as a hobbyist
